Get busy with life’s purpose, toss asideempty hopes, get active in your own rescue—if you care for yourself at all—and do it while youcan.”—MARCUS AURELIUS,  MEDITATIONS , 3.14ooohe purpose of all our reading and studying is to aid us in the pursuit of the good life (and death). Atsome point, we must put our books aside and take action. So that, as Seneca put it, the “wordsbecome works.” There is an old saying that a “scholar made is a soldier spoiled.” We want to be bothscholars and soldiers—soldiers in the good fight.That’s what’s next for you. Move forward, move onward. Another book isn’t the answer. The rightchoices and decisions are. Who knows how much time you have left, or what awaits us tomorrow?",
